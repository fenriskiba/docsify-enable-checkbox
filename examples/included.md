# Enabled Example
**If you are viewing this from the Github code view, please go to [the Github Pages site](https://fenriskiba.github.io/docsify-enable-checkbox/#/examples/included.md) to see the example in action.**

Since this page has checkboxes enabled by default, the following Markdown will result in checkboxes that users can interact with.

```markdown
- [x] test
- [ ] check
- [ ] boxes
```

And so they are enabled with the preset checks included:

- [x] test
- [ ] check
- [ ] boxes

!> **Important:** Since these checkboxes are not persisted, if you refresh this page, the checks will reset to the default, even if you did interact with them.
